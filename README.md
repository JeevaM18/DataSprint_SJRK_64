# 🏝️ Corporate Wellness Gamified Survival Adventure

## 📌 Project Overview
Gamifies corporate wellness by turning employee health, nutrition, and activity into a survival adventure. Teams collect resources (firewood, food, water, shelter) by achieving real-world wellness goals. Failures such as absenteeism, stress, or poor nutrition trigger in-game disasters.

## 🎯 Features
- **Core Survival Resources** – Maps real-world wellness data (steps, sleep, nutrition, stress) to in-game survival elements.  
- **Personalized Goals** – BMI and calorie-based goals adjust daily steps and food intake for weight gain, loss, or maintenance.  
- **Food Court Integration** – Employees select meals; system analyzes nutrition and suggests balanced combinations.  
- **Gamification & Rewards** – Daily missions, weekly survival episodes, badges, and leaderboards keep employees engaged.  
- **AI Therapy Chatbot** – Provides mental wellbeing support and translates stress-relief actions into in-game benefits.
